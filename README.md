## Contentful Deploy demo

This is a simple repository with a build script that will insert the value of a
CONTENTFUL_TOKEN environment variable.

The [netlify.toml](netlify.toml) file for the repo configures some template settings
that makes this repo usable with a netlify deploy button like the one below:
